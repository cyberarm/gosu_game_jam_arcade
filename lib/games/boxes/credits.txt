"Boxes !" is a small game made by Guillaume Quillet, aka "Bestguigui", for the first Gosu Game Jam.

It was made using the ruby programing language and the gem gosu only.

You have to sort the boxes falling from the top right corner using three sorting areas. 

Boxes are placed on the conveyer that you can control the speed of. Clicking on an ejection spot will eject the first box to the sorting area.

You can use the 1-2-3 keys to control speed and Q-W-E to eject boxes instead of the mouse if you want to.

When your first box is placed inside an area, the color is chosen. Placing the same color for the entire area will give extra points.

If a box leaves the screen, you get malus points. And if your dropping boxes reach 20 boxes, it's game over.

Have Fun !
