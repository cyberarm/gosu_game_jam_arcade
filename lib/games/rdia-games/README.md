This game was created (in a hurry) for the Gosu Game Jam.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/dbroemme/rdia-games.git
cd rdia-games
./bin/setup
./run-bricks
```
## Instructions

Use your paddle to keep the ball in play while collecting as many dots and eliminating
as many bricks as you can. Don't take too long though because the fire level is rising
and will take one of your balls away.

Movement:
```
A/S   - move left
D     - move right
Space - increase the ball speed
```
