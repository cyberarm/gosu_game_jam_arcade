It is summer in Brickland, and you need to get your ball to the
green field out of the castle before it is engulfed in flames.
Clear as many bricks and collect as many dots as you can
along the way before exiting into the green area at the top.
Don't take too long because the fire level will be rising.

Start:  Space bar to launch your ball
          A/D to move launch angle left/right
          W/S to speed up or slow down the launch 
Play:   A - move left
          D - move right
          Space bar - increase ball speed
